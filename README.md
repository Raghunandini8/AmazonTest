# AmazonTest
I have used BDD approach to create automation testing scenrio.
I have used Maven as build automation tool
Also, I have used Page Object Model framework with Page Factory design pattern for WebElements initialization.
Created a Test Runner class to execute BDD scenario and also it is very easy to scale up this framework large enterprise test automation needs.
